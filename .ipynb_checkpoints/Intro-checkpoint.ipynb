    "3. Time Dependency >> The values for every period are effected by not only outside factors, but also by the values of past periods\n",
    "4. Time Series data suffers from \"Seasonality\" like some data like Temperature, Rain can be varied depends of the time of day, time the year or certain seasons\n",
